My understanding about the project description: 
My app name will be: Cefalo Travel Connect
Specification: web application
Purpose: share, plan, experience travel in a collaborative, data-driven way.

Key features: 
1. Social sharing: users publish detailed travel logs. categories or chunks include: transport, lodging, dining, attractions, metrics(resources)-cost, time, physical effort.
consideration: i need to maintain these categories so that it can enhance the searching ( all posts with the searched category ). better I will take input based on the category/category wise.basic task.

2. Wishlist management: crud operation mainly. Personal and group travel wishlist. enriched with geolocation.
   
3. Group discovery: 'Your fellow travelers' finding with matching interests or overlapping wishlist. Matching can be done by any parameter. like cost, vacation, wishlist. Actually they want to know my potential. 
4. Location Services: Integrate external APIs to find nearby hotels, transport options and POIs. On travel nearby interested places suggest korbe.
   
5. Proximity Notifications: receive notif when come closer to a destination. Receive alerts when arriving near whishlist locations or meetup radius. 

Audience and user roles:
Travelers: document journeys and plan future trips.
Explorers: users seeking inspiration via others' shared experiences or public wishlists.
Admins/Moderators: curate content quality, manage categories, oversee API integrations

Frontend: reactjs, nodejs. typescript.


User's dashboard

Social Sharing: 
----------------


Users publish detailed travel logs, categorized by transport, lodging, dining, attractions, and metrics (cost, time, physical effort).
What I have thought about the requirements are: 
UI and functionality: 
ekta form thakbe. jokhon user share experience name ekta button click korbe, tokhon ei form ta open hbe. okhane category kora thkbe. jemon- transport, lodging, dining, attractions, and metrics (cost, time, physical effort). erpor jokhon onno user ra eita dekhbe tara hoyto eksathe merged post dekhte pare abar category headline er under e dekhte pare.  
ekta filtering thkbe category wise. filtering theke kono point select krle oi point r part tuku shudu dekhabe shb post r jnno. // better search option
button duita: share your experience , search
ekhon database kivabe handle korbo ekhane. ?? database e ki shob field thaka mandatory korbo??  
well ekbar post share kore felle edit r option o rakha lgbe. 
ask korbo: picture option ar geo-tagged option rakhbo kina.

Wishlist Management:
----------------------

I can update and delete my wishlist.

🔍 What It Actually Means:
Users individually add locations to their wishlists.

The system automatically detects overlap in wishlist destinations (e.g., both users want to visit London).

When overlap is found:

The users are grouped together for that specific destination.

This forms a dynamic group or interest cluster.

They can then optionally initiate chats, plan trips together, (or receive group notifications).

Wishlist {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  location: string;
  geo: { lat: number, lng: number };
  note: string;
}

GroupMatch {
  location: string;
  usersInterested: User[];
}

🤝 Related Features You Can Add
“Find matching users for this wishlist item”

“Join planning group” button

“View group suggestions for wishlist destinations”

“Notify me when 3+ people want to go here too”


1. Map Visualization
Show all wishlist destinations as pins on a map (e.g., Leaflet, Google Maps, Mapbox).

View heatmaps of where users want to go most.

2. Proximity Features
Trigger notifications when a user enters a radius near a wishlist location (geo-fencing).

“Hey! You're 2km from your wishlist spot in London!”


3. Nearby Services via API
Use services like Google Places, Yelp, Booking.com, etc., to show:

Hotels

Restaurants

Attractions

Example: “Show hotels within 5km of this wishlist point.”

4. Smart Grouping
Group users by geo-distance, not just location name.

Example: “Paris” vs “Versailles” → 20km apart → Could group if within radius.


5. Travel Time Calculations
Calculate routes and travel time between wishlist points.

Helps in planning realistic itineraries.

🧱 How to Represent It in the Database (Prisma example)
ts
Copy
Edit
model Wishlist {
  id          String   @id @default(uuid())
  userId      String
  location    String
  latitude    Float
  longitude   Float
  note        String?
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())

  user        User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
}
📌 Sources of Geolocation
When the user adds a wishlist location:

Use an API like Google Places, OpenStreetMap (Nominatim), or Mapbox Geocoding to convert "London" into { lat, lng }.

👀 Example Use Case in UI
You type: "Kyoto"
→ API returns:
lat: 35.0116, lng: 135.7681
→ This is stored in your wishlist entry
→ On the map, you see a pin
→ You can get nearby train stations and attractions

🧠 Why Use Tagging?
➕ Benefits:
Users can filter posts by tags (e.g., “Show me beach trips with low effort in summer”).

Enables recommendations (e.g., “You liked posts tagged with ‘mountain’—here are more”).

Helps build a smart search engine or category-based explore feed.

Publish Experience
As a Traveler, I can create a travel post with sections for transport, hotel, food, places to visit, and personal metrics (cost, duration, effort), so that others can learn from my journey.
Workflow: Upload images ➔ Tag categories ➔ Attach geo-tracks ➔ Publish.

Build Wishlist
As an Explorer, I can add destinations to my wishlist, group them by region or theme, and share with friends or the community. 
Workflow: Search POI ➔ Add to wishlist ➔ Annotate notes ➔ Share link.
search bar,(view in map) add to the wishlist, grouping, annotate notes, share link. 

Matchmaking & Planning
As a Planner, I can find other users whose wishlists overlap with mine, and initiate a group chat or trip planning session.
Workflow: Select a wishlist item ➔ View "Users Interested" ➔ Message or invite to plan.
The planner include details about transportation, hotels, stay, cost, place to visit etc that can be facilitated by third party apis


Discover Services
As a Traveler, I can search for nearby hotels, transport (flights, trains, rentals), and restaurants around any geotagged point, using third-party APIs.
Workflow: Click map marker ➔ Display list of services ➔ Filter by price/rating.


Arrival Notifications
As an Active Traveler, I receive an in-browser or mobile push notification when I enter a configurable radius (e.g., 1 km) around a wishlist spot or meetup location.
Workflow: Enable notifications ➔ Set radius per item ➔ Travel begins ➔ Receive alert.
