My understanding about the project description: 
My app name will be: Cefalo Travel Connect
Specification: web application
Purpose: share, plan, experience travel in a collaborative, data-driven way.

Key features: 
1. Social sharing: users publish detailed travel logs. categories or chunks include: transport, lodging, dining, attractions, metrics(resources)-cost, time, physical effort.
consideration: i need to maintain these categories so that it can enhance the searching ( all posts with the searched category ). better I will take input based on the category/category wise. basic task.
2. Wishlist management: crud operation mainly. Personal and group travel wishlist. enriched with geolocation.
3. Group discovery: 'Your fellow travelers' finding with matching interests or overlapping wishlist. Matching can be done by any parameter. like cost, vacation, wishlist. Actually they want to know my potential. 
4. Location Services: Integrate external APIs to find nearby hotels, transport options and POIs. On travel nearby interested places suggest korbe.
5. Proximity Notifications: receive notif when come closer to a destination. Receive alerts when arriving near whishlist locations or meetup radius. 

Audience and user roles:
Travelers: document journeys and plan future trips.
Explorers: users seeking inspiration via others' shared experiences or public wishlists.
Admins/Moderators: curate content quality, manage categories, oversee API integrations
