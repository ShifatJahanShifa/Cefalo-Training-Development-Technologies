# Function  
We can create function in two ways. 
1. Using function declaration also known as function statement.
2. Using function expression. 

## Usage of function expression

We can use function expression in following ways:   
1. We can assign the function expression in a variable, array element, object property.
2. We can pass the function expression as an argument to anither function.
3. We can return the function expression from another function. [N.B: this is a concept named `closures`].   
   
## Differences between function declaration and function expression 
There are mainly two differences between them. Such as: 
1. The most important difference between a function declaration and a function expression is that we can create anonymous function using function expression.
2. One is hoisted while the other is not.

## IIFE
IIFE stands for `Immediately Invoked Function Expression`.
