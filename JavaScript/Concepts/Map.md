# Keyed Collections

In object, we cannot use an object as a key but in map we can do so.  There is no limitation on what can be a key of map object. // I need more clarification on that.
in boject, i could not do the iteration using `for...of` loop. But what i saw in `map` just now is that i can use `for...of` with this and in result , i get array containing each element of map.  

## concerns

1. To iterate over object or to sort an object, we need to convert it into array at first.
2. Looping was not problematic with array. but pulling out a specific value without index was not straightforward. 

## SET
characteristics: 
1. unique.
2. elements are in no particular order.
