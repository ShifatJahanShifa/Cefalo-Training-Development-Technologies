JS has 3 types of scope. 
1. block scope
2. function scope
3. global scope
4. local scope ( local to a function)

`Block Scope`    
`let` and `const` are block scope. Whereas, `const` is not block scope. 

`Function Scope` 
`let`, `const`, `const` all show quite similar behavior in case of function scope. 

`Global Scope` 
Variable declared outside function is in global scope. 

> Accidential or automatically global variable
