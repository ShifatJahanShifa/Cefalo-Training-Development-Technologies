This means that in Node.js, most file system (fs) operations like reading or writing files can be done in **three ways**:

1. **Synchronous (blocking)** – Executes immediately and blocks further code execution until done.

   ```js
   const data = fs.readFileSync('file.txt', 'utf-8');
   ```

2. **Callback-based (asynchronous)** – Uses a callback function to handle the result when it's done.

   ```js
   fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf-8', (err, data) => { console.log(data); });
   ```

3. **Promise-based (asynchronous)** – Returns a promise you can `await`.

   ```js
   const data = await fs.promises.readFile('file.txt', 'utf-8');
   ```

Also, these can be used with either:

* **CommonJS** syntax (`require`)
* **ES Modules** syntax (`import`)

So, Node.js gives you flexibility to pick the style that fits your project.
