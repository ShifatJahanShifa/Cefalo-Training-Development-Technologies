## What is the issue with JavaScript?
Every language has some quirks. So does js. 
Problems: 
1. in comparision, js allows automatic coercion of the operands which results in unexpected behavior.
2. js also allows accessing of properties of object which are not present. 

In small code, it is not problematic but in large scale application, in future it may create serious problem.
